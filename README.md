Commit and push your work, and when your code is on `main` branch, you can launch:

And fill the correct new version of the package.

When your new icons has been published, you will need to create a new branch `update-version-X.X.X`, update the version for the correct version in the package.json at the root directory.

## How add a new component?

Create a new directory in `/src/components`, add `index.js` (__required__ - your component), `style.js` (if necessary) and a `stories.js` (__required__)

Write your code, ‚ö†Ô∏è don't forget to fill the PropTypes (__required__), write your stories and explain each prop in the story.

If you want to add a dependency to get more efficient, it's possible!
```
yarn add DEPENDENCY_NAME
```

In package.json, copy the line from peer and paste it into __peerDependencies__

You will need to reference your new component for the export, to do that, be sure of the presence of your component in the main [index.js](/src/index.js).
